Phase 1: Gather data on each package, including but not limited to:
- Source repository
- Development activity
- Communication channel
- Programming language
- License
- List of important features
- Popularity (only in cases where it's obvious)

Eliminate any contenders that don't mean the minimum threshold (e.g. incompatible license, no community support, missing required feature, written in whitespace, etc).

Phase 2:

- Setup and test the package
- Validate the functionality and gather information about distinguishing features
- Benchmark when necessary
- Note resource utilization
- Rate the quality of the documentation and ease of use

Phase 3:
Review with the team, present your findings and address any concerns. Aim to achieve consensus.
